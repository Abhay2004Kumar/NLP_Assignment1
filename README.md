# Assignment 1: Co-occurrence Matrix and Word Embeddings

This project implements **count-based word embeddings** using a **co-occurrence matrix**.  
The implementation covers:
- Extracting distinct words (vocabulary) from a corpus
- Constructing a co-occurrence matrix with a sliding window
- Dimensionality reduction (SVD) to produce low-dimensional embeddings
- Plotting the resulting embeddings in 2D space
